##Don't like Orange?

I have 3 other flavors for you. Not everyone likes Orange. Since iOrange 1.0 was released in 2008, I've no idea why I chose Orange as primary color. Just make the following changes and you will love the color psychology. You will need to edit `main.css` and make change to header, nav and footer elements.

### Turquoise:

    .header-container {background: #7DA7D9;}
    #nav {background: #6697D2;}
    .footer-container { border-bottom : 2px solid #6697D2;}

### Emerald:

    .header-container {background: #50C878;}
    #nav {background: #37AE5E;}
    .footer-container {border-bottom : 2px solid #37AE5E;}

### Ruby:

    .header-container {background: #E0115F;}
    #nav { background: #B40E4D; }
    .footer-container { border-bottom : 2px solid #B40E4D;}
